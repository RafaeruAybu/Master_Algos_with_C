This chapter covers:
Pointer fundamentals.
    Including one of the best techniques for understanding pointers: drawing diagrams.
    Another fundamental aspect of pointer usage is learning how to avoid dangling pointers.

Storage allocation.
    The process of reserbing space in memory. understanding pointers as they relate to storage allocation is especially important because pointers are a virtual carte blanche when it comes to accessing memory.

Aggregates and pointer arithmetic.
    In C, aggreagates are structures and arrays. Pointer arithmetic defines the rules by which calculations with pointers are performed. Pointers to structures are important in building data structures. Array and pointers in C use pointer arithmetic in the same way.

Pointers as parameters to functions.
    The means by which C simulates all-by-reference parameter passing. In C, it is also common to use pointers as an efficient means of passing arrays and large structures.

Pointers to pointers.
    Pointers that point to other pointers instead of pointing to data. Pointers to pointers are particularly common as parameters to functions.

Generic pointers and casts.
    Mechanisms that bypass and override C`s type system. Generic pointer let us point to data without being concerned with its type for the moment. Casts allow us to override the type of a variable temporarily.

Function pointer.
    Pointers that point to executable code, or blocks of information needed to invoke executable code, instead ofpointing to data. They are used to store and manage functions as if were pieces of data.
